# MyReads Project

A bookshelf app allow a user to select and categorize books. The book can be read, currently reading, or want to read.
The user can also type a query to search a book. The books that match the query are displayed on the page.
Search results on the search page allow the user to select “currently reading”, “want to read”, or “read” to place the book in a certain shelf.
